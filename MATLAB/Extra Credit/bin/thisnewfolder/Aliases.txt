5. When you just run the tarball and dont route it somewhere-- all ou see is something similar to what happens when you tar a file. If you create another directory to place the untar files into, you acn then cd to the new directory and see that the files from the tar.gz were untarred and are now displaying in the new folder that you untarred to.

6. In roder to make this a permanent addition to my bash bin folder, I would ask the user for specific input instead of specifically calling for a tarball that I created specific for this part of the lab. I would also ask the user for the name of the directory that the user would like to create for the untarred files to go into. I would then have the script create a directory using the users input as the directory name and then create an equation using the user input for the file that the user would like to untar and the user input of the directory that the user would like to untar to. So I would basically ask for more user input and create more variables if I was making this script a universal option in my bin.

7. I always use 'vi' so I chose to create an alias for vim. I called it "write." I chose to the vim command because I am constantly creating bash scripts in this class for my lab assignments.
