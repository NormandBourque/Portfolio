I first wrote the solution using a MIC 1 emmulator doing it line by line.  The emmulator allowed me to see what is going on at each step.  Then when I tried
to use my final soulution in the emmulator the school uses I had all sorts of compiling errors.  I have never used a flex file before nor have I used a
make file like the one directed to use.  So when I went to compile my solution I was having problems.  It wasn't until I was instructed to make sure I was
on a cirtain server was I able to compile.  The project is already hard enough to compleate without the additional level of not being told up frount 
about errors that could happen if logging onto the cs server.  Once I was able to compile I was confused as to what was problems with my project and 
what was problems with getting loged onto the wrong server.  I do feel if I were properly instructed I could have compleated the project sucessfully.
